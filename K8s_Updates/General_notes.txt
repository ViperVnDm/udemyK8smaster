#By default (without rolling updates),

#Day 2 K8s, need to do rolling update
#DAY to Day rolling updates 

Rolling Updates, (change a deployment spec)
with rolling updates, when a deployment is updated, it happens progressively
The Deployment controls multiple ReplicaSets
Each RepliaSet is a group of identical 

Two to be aware of

maxUnavailable and maxSerge

There will always be at least replicas-maxUnavailable pods available
-If you set 10 and max unavailbale 3

there will never be more than replicas+maxSurge pods in total

there will therefore be up to maxUnavailable+maxSurge pods being updated.
